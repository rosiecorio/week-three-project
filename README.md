Reflection:

ðŸŽ¯ What requirements did you achieve?
I have achieved all requirements for this task. 

My functions are organised and reusable, I have event listeners to handle user interactions, have stored the cookie count and cps in local storage, have used a setInterval to manage the games state and my store upgrades are provided by the API which gives them all functionality.

ðŸŽ¯ Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?

I have achieved all goals I set out to achieve and am very happy with my project.
